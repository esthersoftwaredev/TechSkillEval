# VITSANTIX

## ABOUT

### VITSANTIX is a project I am developing as an ultimate destination for video-based independent technical skills assessments. As the developer behind this platform, my aim is to provide developers and employers with a comprehensive, modern, and reliable assessment solution. 

## TECHNOLOGIES

###

- Angular: The frontend of VITSANTIX is developed using Angular, a popular and powerful JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.

- Python Flask: The backend of VITSANTIX is built with Python Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework that enables rapid development of RESTful APIs.

- SQLite: VITSANTIX utilizes SQLite as its database management system. SQLite is a reliable and efficient embedded database engine that offers robust features and easy integration.

- Deployment: The frontend of VITSANTIX is deployed using Netlify, a popular platform for continuous deployment and hosting static websites. The backend is deployed using Render, a cloud platform that provides scalable and reliable infrastructure for web applications.

- CI/CD: Both frontend and backend deployments of VITSANTIX are implemented with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. This ensures seamless integration of new features, automated testing, and efficient deployment processes.

The `backend` directory contains the backend implementation of VITSANTIX. It includes the `app` directory, which contains files such as `__init__.py`, `auth.py`, `models.py`, and `routes.py`, handling different aspects of the backend logic. The `requirements.txt` file lists the project dependencies, `run.py` is the entry point for running the backend server, and `seed_db.py` handles database seeding.

The `screenshots` directory is used to store screenshots capturing different stages of the development process.

The `venv` directory contains the Python virtual environment for managing project dependencies.

The `vitsantix-angular` directory is where the frontend Angular application is. The `src` directory contains various subdirectories such as `app`, `components`, `models`, `services`, and `assets`, organizing the frontend codebase.

The `package-lock.json` and `package.json` files are related to the project's npm package configuration.
