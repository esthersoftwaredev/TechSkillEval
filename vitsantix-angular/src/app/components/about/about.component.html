				Our platform is designed to revolutionize the way technical skills are
				evaluated and validated, providing a more accurate and reliable measure
				of a developer's abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				The name "VITSANTIX" is a combination of the words "Video," representing
				our video-based assessment approach, and "ITSA," an abbreviation for
				Independent Technical Skills Assessment. Together, they represent our
				commitment to delivering a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of
				technical skills through video assessments.
			</p>
			<p>
				At VITSANTIX, we believe that the traditional methods of assessing
				technical skills are outdated and often fail to capture the true
				abilities of developers. Our video-based assessments provide a more
				dynamic and interactive way to evaluate a developer's skills, allowing
				them to showcase their expertise in real-time and in a comfortable
				environment.

				Our mission is to bridge the gap between developers and employers by
				offering an unbiased and reliable platform for technical skills

				development industry, where all developers have an equal opportunity to
				prove their abilities, regardless of their educational background or
				years of experience.
